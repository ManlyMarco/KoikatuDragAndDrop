# Koikatu Drag and Drop
Adds drag and drop support for Koikatu, making it possible to load character cards by dragging them into the character editor window.

# Limitations
- Only supports dragging from Explorer
- Doesn't support coordinate cards
- Performs no sanity checks
  - For example, you can load characters of the wrong sex, but the original sex will be retained even after saving.
